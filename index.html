                <p>Hello, dear Americans! You all saw it. The DemocRATS finally showed their true faces and laid bare their goals. They are NOT AFTER ME, they are AFTER YOU and OUR COUNTRY! </p>
                <P>It is not only falsification of the elections, it is MURDERING of the main philosophical IDEA of our Nation - VOICE OF EVERY MAN MATTERS!</P>
                <p>Right now it's not. It's brutal BETRAYAL of our origins by the DemocRATS, which we won't take!</p>
                <p>We won't let them destroy our country! As long as Donald Trump is president, this will not happen! He and his legal team will fight to recount the votes in several states where there have been violations.</p>
